## Face Recognition:

This is a simple Python script which uses the images from /dataset directory and generates the output feature vector is 128-d (i.e., a list of 128 real-valued numbers) that is used to quantify the face.

Here the /dataset directory contains images (20 each) of 5 Indian Cricketers: Dravid, Ganguly, MS Dhoni, Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli and the /test directory contains 4 images to test our model.

**Sample output:**
